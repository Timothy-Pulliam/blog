Hello.

That's me and my cat Daisy. I received my Bachelor's of Physics from Rochester Institute of Technology in 2014. After graduating I persued a career as a Linux System Administrator. I started learning web frameworks such as Flask and Node.js, which gave me a greater appreciation for the challenges developers face. I am now focused on closing the gap between Dev and Ops. 

I was diagnosed with [Epilepsy](https://www.epilepsy.com/what-is-epilepsy/statistics) as a teenager.
